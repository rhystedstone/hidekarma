## A simple chrome extension to hide the karma count

HideKarma simply prevents the karma counters from showing on both the userpage (`/u/`) and your profile.

### But why?
I find that the counter aims to compare users and content, however, there are many users who have gained lots of karma from posting thousands of terrible comments / posts.
This allows you to view a user's profile without caring about their karma.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to a folder on your computer
2. Go to`chrome://extensions` and ensure "Developer Mode" is enabled
3. Click "Load Unpacked" and navigate to the folder, then "Select Folder"
